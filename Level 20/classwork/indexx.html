    <p>
        I was born in Rustavi,Georgia and lived there for 2 years.
        I had a happy childhood, as i now i was very naughty and funny.I do not rememder much.
        After 2 years, my life continued in Vitoria-Gasteiz,Spain.
    </p>
    <p> I turned 2 years old in Spain.
        I went to school, everyone spoke an incomprehensible language, I didn't like it very much at first.
        I soon got used to it and I have friends... Spain is also a very beautiful country, but I still like Georgia.
        I want to get back to my routine soon...</p>

    <p>I turned 2 years old in Spain. <br>  I went to school, everyone spoke an incomprehensible language, I didn't like it very much at first. <br>  I soon got used to it and I have friends... Spain is also a very beautiful country, but I still like Georgia. <br>  I want to get back to my routine soon...</p>

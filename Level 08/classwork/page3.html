<h1><u><i><b>AUDI</b></i></u></h1>







<p><i>August Horch (1868-1951), one of the pioneers of the German 
automobile industry, founded the Horch car company in Cologne 
(Germany) in 1899, whose first automobile began to circulate 
on public roads in 1901. After some financial difficulties 
and internal disagreements, he decided to leave the company 
to create a new automobile factory. Thus was born the 
automobile company called «August Horch & Cie.
Motorwagenwerke AG" in Zwickau, on July 16, 1909.
1 As Horch lost the legal dispute over the company's 
name, which was already registered previously, he could 
not use his surname again and chose the name "Audi" because 
at the suggestion of the son of one of the directors, which 
is the Latin translation of the German word "horch", which 
in Spanish means "hear" or "listen".2 Therefore, months after 
its founding, it changed the name of the company to “Audi 
Automobilwerke”.</i></p>
